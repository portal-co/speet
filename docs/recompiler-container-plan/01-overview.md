Overview

Goals
- Recompile every program in a container image into a single, standalone WebAssembly (WASM) megabinary or AOT-compiled artifact.
- Eliminate loader stubs: produce a single unified execution entry point for the container's logic.
- Content-addressable execution: use cryptographic file hashes to map original binaries to their recompiled WASM counterparts, ensuring integrity and failing on launch attempts if hashes mismatch.
- Support agentic AI workloads: provide ultra-fast startup, high-density sandboxing, and deterministic execution for AI agents and tool-use environments, in addition to standard microservices.
- Provide polyfills for binaries that can't be recompiled (JIT-based VMs like V8/Node.js, complex interpreters).
- Enforce a strict no-JIT / no-executable-memory policy using multiple enforcement layers.
- Integrate with container ecosystems (containerd, Kubernetes) while maintaining strong containment and auditability.

Scope
- The plan targets userland containers and AI agent runtimes. It assumes a host-side vkernel process and container runtime shim.
- Support for agentic AI: focus on sandboxing untrusted code generated by LLMs, ensuring strict resource limits, and providing a stable, reproducible environment for agent execution.
- Not all workloads will be immediately supported; some require polyfills or manual intervention (native drivers, FUSE, special device access). The aim is to support common microservice workloads (NGINX, Redis, Node/Express, Python/Flask) and AI agent environments (Python, Bash, custom tools).

Deliverables
- Documentation of architecture and components
- Hash-based mapping format for binaries and their WASM/AOT counterparts
- Prototype unified WASM megabinary and minimal vkernel implementation
- Recompilation toolchain design and reference implementations
- Polyfill library for common runtimes
- Integration shim for container runtimes and AI agent platforms

Audience
- System architects and engineers building the recompiler pipeline
- Security engineers auditing the no-JIT enforcement and vkernel
- Developers building AI agents or porting applications for high-security environments
